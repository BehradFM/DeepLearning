# Cats vs Dogs CNN Project 🐱🐶

![Dataset Cover](https://github.com/BehradFM/DeepLearning/blob/main/Convolutional%20Neural%20Network/CatsvsDogs/Image/dataset-cover.jpeg)

This project implements a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to classify images of cats and dogs. It is designed to demonstrate how CNNs can be applied to binary image classification tasks.  

Unlike MNIST, the dataset is not included by default and needs to be downloaded from Kaggle.

## ✨ Features

- CNN implementation for binary image classification (cats vs dogs).  
- Preprocessing of raw image data for training and evaluation.  
- Training and evaluation pipeline to test classification accuracy.  
- Demonstrates the use of convolutional layers, pooling, and fully connected layers.  

## 🗂 Dataset

- **Cats vs Dogs**: A dataset containing images of cats and dogs.  
- Available on Kaggle: [Cats and Dogs Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/d4rklucif3r/cat-and-dogs)  
- You need to download the dataset manually from Kaggle and place it in your project folder before running the code.

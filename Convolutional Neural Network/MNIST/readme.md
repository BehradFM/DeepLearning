# MNIST CNN Project 🖊️

This project implements a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to classify handwritten digits from the **MNIST dataset**. It provides a clear and straightforward example of how CNNs can be used for image recognition tasks.  

The MNIST dataset is automatically downloaded when running the code, so you don’t need to prepare it manually.

## ✨ Features

- Easy-to-understand CNN implementation suitable for beginners.  
- Automatic download of the MNIST dataset during runtime.  
- Training and evaluation of the model on handwritten digit images.  
- Demonstrates core concepts of convolutional layers, pooling, and dense layers.

## 🗂 Dataset

- **MNIST**: Contains grayscale images of handwritten digits (0–9) with:  
  - 60,000 training images  
  - 10,000 test images  
- Dataset is downloaded automatically when running the code.

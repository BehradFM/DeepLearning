# CIFAR-10 CNN Project ðŸ“¦

This project implements a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to classify images from the **CIFAR-10 dataset**. The dataset contains 60,000 color images across 10 different classes and is a standard benchmark for image classification tasks.  

The CIFAR-10 dataset is automatically downloaded when running the code, so there is no need to prepare it manually.

## âœ¨ Features

- CNN implementation for multi-class image classification.  
- Preprocessing of image data for training and evaluation.  
- Training and testing pipeline to measure classification accuracy.  
- Demonstrates the use of convolutional layers, pooling, dropout, and dense layers.  

## ðŸ—‚ Dataset

- **CIFAR-10**: A collection of 60,000 images (32x32 color) categorized into 10 classes:  
  - airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, truck.  
- The dataset is automatically downloaded during runtime.

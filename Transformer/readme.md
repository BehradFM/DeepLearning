# Human Activity Recognition with Smartphones 📱🏃‍♂️

This project uses the **UCI HAR Dataset** (Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones) to classify different human activities based on smartphone sensor data. The dataset contains accelerometer and gyroscope readings collected from participants performing various activities such as walking, sitting, standing, and lying down.  

The classification task in this project is performed using a **Transformer encoder network**, which is well-suited for handling sequential and time-series data.

## ✨ Features

- Implementation of deep learning models for human activity recognition.  
- Utilization of a **Transformer encoder architecture** for sequence modeling.  
- Preprocessing of raw sensor signals into meaningful features.  
- Training and evaluation on labeled activity data.  
- Demonstrates time-series data classification using neural networks and attention mechanisms.  

## 🗂 Dataset

- **UCI HAR Dataset**: Contains recordings from 30 subjects performing activities of daily living while carrying a waist-mounted smartphone with embedded inertial sensors.  
- Activities include:  
  - Walking  
  - Walking upstairs  
  - Walking downstairs  
  - Sitting  
  - Standing  
  - Laying
